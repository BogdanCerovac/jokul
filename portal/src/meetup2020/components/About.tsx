                    The digital product industry has been welcoming design systems for a while. Many organizations have
                    been better able to preserve brand guidelines, speed up time-to-market, or improve the user&apos;s
                    experience by establishing and maintaining a functioning design system.

                <p>
                    This event will attempt to look beyond: To uncover the good, the bad, and the ugly experiences from
                    inside our design systems. What has thrilled users? Where has it gone wrong? How did we prevail â€“ if
                    at all?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Join us for an exciting look at the inside of a few design systems and the efforts made to make them
                    great.
