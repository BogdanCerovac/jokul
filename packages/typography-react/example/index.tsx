            LeadParagraph: For half-an-hour we were muffled in a cold, damp mist, and total darkness, and had begun to
            think of going indoors when, all at once, the car burst into the pure and starlit region of the upper air.
        </LeadParagraph>
        <P>
            A paragraph (P): The sky of a deep dark blue was hung with innumerable stars, which seemed to float in the
            limpid ether, and the rolling vapours through which we had passed were drawn like a sable curtain between us
            and the lower world. The stillness was so profound that we could hear the beating of our own hearts.
        </P>
        <SmallText>
            SmallText: The unwonted sadness of her tone reminded me of her devoted life, and I turned towards her with
            new interest and sympathy. She was looking at the Evening Star, whose bright beam softened the
            irregularities of her profile, and made her almost beautiful.
